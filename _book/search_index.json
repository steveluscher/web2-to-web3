We are organized as a co-operative of creatives, operators, and investors who are experienced in launching and growing technology businesses.\nWe value the sovereignty that comes with founding a company, the skin in the game that comes with investing, and the joy that comes with getting sh*t done. In a pre-crypto world, we had to fit into broiler categories ‚Äî founder, investor, or employee.

This kind of large scale coordination is now possible in ways it wasn‚Äôt before.\nProducts can now write their data to public blockchains instead of servers owned by any single entity. This means all information is public and no one can be ‚Äúde-platformed‚Äù If a team behind a product goes rogue or makes decisions against the will of their creators or users, the community can simply start a new product, take their data/followers/art and leave.\nThis means all the products as we know them today can be re-created and improved on web3 - the way loans are given, the way music is created, the social networks we use or the way those companies are run.

These are basically pieces of code that follow relatively simple commands of \"when/if then__\" to ensure that all parties receive the benefits or penalties as the contract stipulates and actions require. It also makes a permanent record of every action and reaction in the transaction that takes place on it.\nMoney Transfer\nWho does not love instant money transfers?\nThe Blockchain enables lightning-fast transactions in real-time. This has already transformed the BFSI sector for good as it saves both time and money (mostly eliminates transaction fees charged by centralised banks/financial institutions). \nNFTs (Digital Media)\nHow can you talk about the blockchain and not mention NFTs?\nNon-Fungible Tokens are unique pieces of code on the blockchain that represent digital art, music, piece of code and anything and everything you could think of. These can be traded on the blockchain, and provide ownership to the creator of their digital property.\nCreators and companies have hopped on the NFT train because it can protect their intellectual property, maintain data integrity, target the right customers, and ensure that artists receive their royalty payments in due time.a\nHere's a video to get you going\nurl=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3ptz8qvZcg&feature=emb_title\"\nHere's an article for a complete deep dive\nurl=\"https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game\"\nYou can't go long without Crypto Twitter\nurl=\"https://twitter.com/naval/status/1434586449068756993?s=20\"\nFAQs\nIf you have any doubts related to this topic or you have a suggestion, feel free to create an issue here.\nIf you want to make edits to this topic or update the topic, please click on the \"Edit on Github\" link you see on the right section, make the changes and create a pull request to the master branch.

We've also gone over some of the use cases of a blockchain, including smart contracts.\nThis is where Ethereum comes in.\nEthereum is a general-purpose blockchain that allows developers to easily create and run smart contracts. Creating smart contracts requires the use of Solidity, which is Ethereum's native programming language.\nIn other words, you can think of Ethereum as a large decentralized supercomputer that provides the infrastructure on top of which all kinds of decentralized apps can run. So everything we've discussed before, including DAOs, NFTs and DeFi, can be coded to run on the Ethereum blockchain.\nIts general-purpose nature has seen it become the preferred blockchain for most web3 developers. Indeed, its token ETH has the second-largest market capitalisation after Bitcoin.\nLearn about Ethereum and how it works using the resources below!  \nHere's a video to get you going\nurl=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh5b-MzDl6I&feature=emb_title\"\nurl=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxLkbJozKbY&feature=emb_title\"\nHere's an article for a complete deep dive\nurl=\"https://medium.com/@micheledaliessi/what-is-ethereum-f4c5e566ff77\"\nurl=\"https://www.notboring.co/p/own-the-internet\"\nYou can't go long without Crypto Twitter\nurl=\"https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1425476415064092675?s=20\"\nFAQs\nIf you have any doubts related to this topic or you have a suggestion, feel free to create an issue here.\nIf you want to make edits to this topic or update the topic, please click on the \"Edit on Github\" link you see on the right section, make the changes and create a pull request to the master branch.

An L1 provides the infrastructure or pipelines on which all kinds of dApps, Smart Contracts and decentralized exchanges can be deployed.\nBut what differentiates Solana from other L1s, especially Ethereum? The answer is speed, cost and resultantly efficiency. As we‚Äôve discussed all blockchains must use some kind of consensus mechanism to validate transactions that occur on-chain. Bitcoin and Ethereum (for now) use a proof of work consensus mechanism, which requires validators to contribute computing power to solve complex mathematical problems or hashes.\nSolana, on the other hand, uses a novel consensus mechanism known as Proof of History (explained in detail in the video below). Proof of History allows Solana to create blocks much faster than PoW, which in turn increases speed (nearly 50k transactions per second) and reduces fees for transactions.\nFast speeds and low transaction costs have led to Solana‚Äôs emergence as a preferred L1 solution for all kinds of DeFi, NFT and fantasy sports platforms. Its popularity can be gauged by the fact that Solana is now the 5th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\nLearn about Solana and how it works from its founder, Anatoly, in the video below:  \nHere's a video to get you going\nurl=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6mNSKbKug&feature=emb_title\"\nurl=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rywOYfGu4EA&feature=emb_title\"\nHere's an article for a complete deep dive\nurl=\"https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-solana\"\nYou can't go long without Crypto Twitter\nurl=\"https://twitter.com/kashdhanda/status/1444882361414344704?s=20\"\nFAQs\nIf you have any doubts related to this topic or you have a suggestion, feel free to create an issue here.\nIf you want to make edits to this topic or update the topic, please click on the \"Edit on Github\" link you see on the right section, make the changes and create a pull request to the master branch.

This ensures that no single person, government, or authority can shut Bitcoin down.\nAs long as there is at least a single copy of the node, Bitcoin continues to be around. Miners maintaining the network validate transactions and ensure the network is up and running and are financially incentivized to guard it.\nWhat does a transaction on Bitcoin look like?\nEvery time a transaction occurs miners across the globe rush to validate this transaction, when they do so successfully, they are able to charge a transaction fee for the same. A Bitcoin mine.\nThis is different from our traditional banking system where we rely on a central authority to protect our wealth & help carry out transactions.\nBitcoin can also be split into something called Satoshi or SATs. ( A satoshi is the smallest unit of a bitcoin, equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin.) This also solves our problem with splitting value, the kind we saw with gold and the barter exchange system.\nAs the year's pass, the number of Bitcoins that can be mined keeps reducing i.e every 4 years there is an event called the halvening. This means that the amount of Bitcoin rewarded to the miners for securing the network reduces by half every 4 years. Thus reducing the issuance rate. This reduction in supply over the years increases scarcity.\nA simple rule of thumb:\nHigh Demand + Low supply = Increase in prices.\nThis applies to Bitcoin as well. Bitcoin has a definite supply of 21 Million BTC, of which 18 Million+ BTC have already been mined. The last Bitcoin will only be mined in the year 2140.\nHere's a video to get you going\nurl=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzvRxoJCaRA&feature=emb_title\"\nurl=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrMJVVR4X7w\"\nHere's an article for a complete deep dive\nurl=\"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/is-bitcoin-anarchy-or-civilization\"\nYou can't go long without Crypto Twitter\nurl=\"https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1392904263123283975\"\nFAQs\nIf you have any doubts related to this topic or you have a suggestion, feel free to create an issue here.\nIf you want to make edits to this topic or update the topic, please click on the \"Edit on Github\" link you see on the right section, make the changes and create a pull request to the master branch.

The contract defines the rules of the organisation and holds the group‚Äôs treasury. Once the contract is live on Ethereum, no one can change the rules except by a vote. If anyone tries to do something that‚Äôs not covered by the rules and logic in the code, it will fail. And because the treasury is defined by the smart contract too that means no one can spend the money without the group‚Äôs approval either. (via ethereum.org)\n\nThis is a key element in the functioning as the pursuit of code being law is very much evident here at a micro and organisational level just like it is in the larger scheme of things with cryptocurrency and the DeFi industry as a whole.\nAnother key feature of how a DAO functions is the distribution of the decision making powers which are usually done proportionately to the amount of contribution each person makes to the DAO. This is a step up from the organisations of web2 as it not only goes away from the traditional corporate hierarchies but also gives each member a say over what moves should the organisation make next.\nHere's a video to get you going\nurl=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VFg67z7XYQ&feature=emb_title\"\nHere's an article for a complete deep dive\nurl=\"https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o\"\nYou can't go long without Crypto Twitter\nurl=\"https://twitter.com/petergyang/status/1447605297808232448\"\nurl=\"https://twitter.com/divine_economy\"\nFAQs\nIf you have any doubts related to this topic or you have a suggestion, feel free to create an issue here.\nIf you want to make edits to this topic or update the topic, please click on the \"Edit on Github\" link you see on the right section, make the changes and create a pull request to the master branch.

The article provided below points out two concepts for this.\n\nLegal Liability\nTax Protection\n\n\n\"The first is obvious - if you are setting up a DAO, neither you nor the actual members of the DAO should be putting themselves in any legal jeopardy.

There are multiple factors that govern the direction that a tokenomics of a DAO can take like:\n\nSupply and demand\nLiquidity\nInflation\n\nThe 2 most common requirements for any kind of DAO is the need of a community of people and the capital in its treasury. People working on building products, content, design for the DAO can generate income for themselves this way and in turn create income for the DAO subsequently.\nSome DAOs, like the Superteam DAO prefer to not have their own token, but use a reputation system for governance and pay members with stablecoins.

You exchange it for another Bitcoin and you'll still hold the same value. This is because 1 Bitcoin is the same as the other. It is fungible\nBut the same is not true with NFTs.\nYou may have come across the popular NFT CryptoPunk. One CryptoPunk is not equal to the other. Each of them is unique with different attributes. This is what makes them non-fungible\nSo what do NFTs represent?\nNFTs are not the digital items themselves. Think of it as a digital certificate. Unlike physical items, digital items can be copied easily. These copies are indistinguishable from each other.\nNFTs solve this.\nIt has the information to identify the authenticity of the digital items and their ownership history as well. This information is stored on the blockchain which makes NFTs immutable. The current use of NFTs which is getting the hype is digital art and the communities around it. Digital art being sold for millions is slowly becoming common.\nBut NFTs can represent other digital items like in-game items, songs, videos, collectibles, domain names, tickets etc. You name it.

They're all showing the same image, but they're not worth hanging in the Louvre.\nThe authenticity of the original art piece remains true in the physical world, and NFTs make it possible to apply that concept in the digital realm as well.\nBeing on the blockchain, owning an NFT gives you provable ownership of the original piece so no matter how many times someone else right click, save as's your piece, it will still remain yours to keep.\nNot to mention, NFTs offer myriad utilities on top of them as well.

The media can be anything digital, including art, videos, music, gifs, games, text, memes, and code. NFTs contain highly trustworthy documentation of their history and origin, and can have code attached to do almost anything programmers dream up (one popular feature is code that ensures that the original creator receives royalties from secondary sales).\" - Chris Dixon\n\nWe've mentioned these points before, but it's important to reiterate as these factors make the NFT ecosystem a goldmine of opportunities for Creators and Artists.\nFor the longest time, creators have struggled with rights over their intellectual property and institutions ripping them off because of their grip over the market. NFTs allow creators to own their pieces of art, buy and sell them as and when they want and also utilise them in any way they feel like. We're already seeing singers launching their albums as NFTs so users can buy them from them directly, creating an economy around their art pieces.\nThe possibilities for a creator here are endless.

Research about what the project is looking to do in the future always pays off as it is a good sign of its longevity. In a constantly evolving space, a solid plan about future drops, utility, etc. will pay off in the end. \nUtility\nNFTs are abundant. Just a PFP might not be able to cut it in this ever-growing space. That is why a lot of new projects are coming up with different utilities attached to their NFT projects.

Let's see how we can create and sign a transaction through the wallets.\nPrerequisites:\nyarn add @solana/web3.js@1\n\nOR\nnpm i @solana/web3.js@1\n\nLet's import some constructors from this module:\n// wallet.ts\n\nimport {\n  Connection,\n  Transaction,\n  SystemProgram,\n  PublicKey\n} from '@solana/web3.js';\n\nIf you're coming from the last article, you know that we have a file that exports the user's wallet and a method that connects to the wallet in this file itself, if you've missed that I highly recommend that you check out the last article. So let's import the getWallet function in this file.\nimport { getWallet } from './exportWallet.ts'\n\nWe now have everything we need, let's create a function to send SOLs.\nexport const sendMoney = async (to: PublicKey, amount: number) => {\n  const wallet = getWallet()\n  const sender = connectWallet()\n  const environment = \"mainnet-beta\"\n  const network = `https://api.${environment}.solana.com`\n\n  // This method connects to the mainnet-beta solana network,\n  // you can change it to devnet as well.\n\n  const connection = new Connection(network)\n\n  // Let's construct the transaction here\n  const transaction = new Transaction()\n    .add(\n      SystemProgram.transfer({\n        fromPubkey: sender,\n        toPubkey: to,\n        lamports: amount * 1000000000,\n      })\n    );\n\n // These are the transaction instructions,\n // 1 SOL = 1000000000 LAMPs\n\n  const { blockhash } = await connection.getRecentBlockhash()\n  transaction.recentBlockhash = blockhash\n  transaction.feePayer = publicKey\n\n // This transaction needs to be signed by the user before it can\n // be sent\n  let signedTransaction = await wallet.signTransaction(transaction)\n\n  // Let's send this transaction to the network now\n\n  try {\n    const txid = await connection.sendRawTransaction(\n      signedTransaction.serialize()\n    )\n    return txid;\n  catch (error) {\n    console.error(error)\n  }\n\n}\n\nNow we can utilize this function anywhere in our working directory. There are\nimport { sendMoney } from './wallet.ts'\nimport { PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js'\n\nasync function main() {\n  const receiver = new PublicKey(\"....\") // Receiver's Address\n  const txid = await sendMoney(receiver, 1) // Send 1 SOL\n}\n\nFAQs\nIf you have any doubts related to this topic or you have a suggestion, feel free to create an issue here.\nIf you want to make edits to this topic or update the topic, please click on the \"Edit on Github\" link you see on the right section, make the changes and create a pull request to the master branch.

The Backend generates the hash and stores it to the DB, then that hash is returned in the response.\nFrontend receives the hash from the response and gets it signed from the user's wallet.\nIt sends the signature along with the other parameters required for the authentication gated action.\nBackend gets the hash from the DB and decodes the received signature to verify if its valid.\n\nDecoding the signature in the Backend:\nFor JavaScript:\n\nhttps://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/blob/master/README.md#naclsigndetachedverifymessage-signature-publickey\n\nIf the signature is valid, the Backend does the requested authentication gated action and sends the success response to the Frontend and the Frontend displays a success message.\nIf we want to reduce friction for the user, the Backend could generate a token for the user after the signature is verified and send it to the Frontend for storing and authorizing actions until the token expires. It would prevent the need for signing a message on every action.\nFAQs\nIf you have any doubts related to this topic or you have a suggestion, feel free to create an issue here.\nIf you want to make edits to this topic or update the topic, please click on the \"Edit on Github\" link you see on the right section, make the changes and create a pull request to the master branch.
