# About Ground Zero

Ground Zero is a project by members of [Superteam DAO](https://superteam.fun) to help people learn about the basics of the crypto ecosystem for free.

We accomplish this by curating info about various topics with a quick summary, which includes videos, articles & tweets to help you understand the basics of the topic- all freely available to the public.

### About Superteam DAO

![](<.gitbook/assets/61a87356101a9ef9bcf3d3a5\_superteam (1).png>)

Superteam DAO helps the most promising projects in the **Solana** ecosystem in the ascending world (India, South East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa) launch and grow. We are organized as a co-operative of creatives, operators, and investors who are experienced in launching and growing technology businesses.

We value the sovereignty that comes with founding a company, the skin in the game that comes with investing, and the joy that comes with getting sh\*t done. In a pre-crypto world, we had to fit into broiler categories — founder, investor, or employee. Crypto allows us to be free-range and be all 3 at the same time.
